# Polytopia Battle Calculator

This is a Javascript program that allows you to test for combat results in The Battle of Polytopia. The project is unofficial, but updated on a regular basis as the developer releases more content for the game.

In the most recent update, I added support for Elyrion units as well as some QoL improvements for easier use. The least obvious change was that you can now access a brief combat history for the current session. Just click or tap three times on any text below „Result:“ after you perform your first battle. Refer to the changelog for other changes.

The calculator also features a detailed FAQ! It contains information regarding the calculation formula and corresponding game mechanics, and its links section steadily grew over time into a decent compilation of game sites, guides and gameplay videos.

If you want to use it offline, download the index.html file and run it in your browser - press Clone or download, followed by Download ZIP, and then extract the file. The calculator FAQ contains information on how to run it offline on iOS and Android.

Happy battling!
