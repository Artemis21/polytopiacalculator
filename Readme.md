# Polytopia Battle Calculator

This is a Javascript program that allows you to test for combat results in The Battle of Polytopia. The project is unofficial, but it's updated on a regular basis as the developer releases more content for the game.

To use the calculator, simply go here: https://frothfrenzy.github.io/polytopiacalculator/

In the most recent update, I added support for Elyrion units as well as some QoL improvements for easier use. The least obvious change was that you can now access a brief combat history for the current session. Just click or tap three times on any text below "Result:" after you perform your first battle. Refer to the changelog file for other changes.

The calculator also features a detailed FAQ! It contains information regarding the calculation formula with its corresponding game mechanics, and the links section steadily grew over time into a decent compilation of game sites, guides and gameplay videos.

If you want to use it offline, download the index.html file on your PC and run it in your browser - press "Clone or download", followed by "Download ZIP", and then extract the file. The calculator FAQ contains more information on how to run it offline both on iOS and Android.

[Contact me](mailto:frothdiscord@gmail.com) if you have any suggestions or bug reports. Also, if you know of any quality guides or gameplay videos that aren't listed in the FAQ links section, let me know.

Happy battling!
